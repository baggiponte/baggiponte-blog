My previous post had quite some code repetitions that could have been cut down by defining some custom functions. Then I encountered several Hadley's talks on functional programming with `purrr` and I was thrilled.

The concept is the following:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
```


```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  split(diamonds$color)
```
